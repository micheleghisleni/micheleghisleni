# Hi there, I'm Michele üëã

## About Me

Hello! I'm Michele, an ambitious and skilled Automation and Control Engineer from the esteemed Politecnico di Milano, where I'm completing my Master's degree. With a foundation built on a Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering, where I graduated with high honors, I've honed my skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and innovative project management. Throughout my academic journey, I've been actively involved in research, team projects, and international exchanges, including an enriching Erasmus experience at Chalmers University of Technology.

As I approach the completion of my Master's program in April 2024, I am keenly seeking career opportunities that not only challenge me but also offer the chance to make significant contributions to my field. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring job opportunities in Spain, a country I'm drawn to for its rich culture, dynamic work environment, and potential for professional growth. My aim is to apply my expertise in automation, control engineering, and human-robot interaction (HRI) in a role that allows for creative problem-solving and innovation.

With proficiency in a range of IT skills, including advanced programming languages and engineering software, and a passion for collaborative projects, I am ready to embark on the next phase of my career. Whether it's in developing intelligent systems, enhancing automation processes, or contributing to groundbreaking projects, I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a forward-thinking team in Spain.
